                    This can be the first recipe you ever cook. Or the second. Or the third. 
                    In any case, it is good practice.

                    If you really do not like onions, you can skip it. However, even if you do
                    not appreciate raw onions, you make like onions in dishes or, at least, dishes
                    that contain onions. And onions form the base or part of the base to multiple cuisines
                    and many, many dishes. So it might be worthwhile to learn to use them.

                <h4>Onion Spread</h4>

                <h5>Ingredients</h5>
                <ul>1 onion</ul>
                <ul>2 cloves of garlic</ul>
                <ul>3 table spoons of oil or butter (olive oil if you have it)</ul>
                <ul>1/2 teasponn salt</ul>
                <ul>1/4 teaspoon pepper</ul>
                <ul>2 tablespoons of cream cheese (optional)</ul>

                <h5>Instructions</h5>
                <p>1. Read through the entire recipe, including the notes (this step is implied in other recipes).</p>
                <p>
                    2. Peel the onion. To do this, it is easier to start at the top (away from the roots).
                    Then cut it in half by placing the onion on its side on the cuttingboard and cutting down.
                    Next, set one of the halves aside and put the other so the surface you just created
                    with the cut is on the cutting board. Slice the top and the roots off. With your nondominant hand hold 
                    the onion and with your dominant hand hold the knife and place it an inch from the end of the onion. Cut most of the way 
                    through the onion, leaving just enough so the piece doesn't fall off. Move the knife an inch away and make
                    another cut again most of the way through. Make cuts parallel to each other until there is less than an
                    inch of onion left. Turn the onion nintety degrees, so that the cuts are parallel to the edge of the counter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cut most of the way through the onion an inch away from the end of it. Move the knife an inch from the 
                    cut you made and cut again. Repeat until the end of the onion. Then repeat the cutting procedure with the other 
                    half of the onion. Once done, cut larger pieces of onion to match the others. Put the onions in a bowl
                    in the fridge.
                </p>

                <p>
                   Cutting into most onions will make you tear up. If the tears prevent you from seeing, stop and walk away 
                   until you can see again. Cutting onions will get easier with practice.

                    Actually, this is easier to explain in person or in video. So here's a video from a chef named Jean Piere:

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwRttSfnfcc">How to Chop an Onion</a>

                <br>

                <p>
                    2. Peel the garlic. Cut into small pieces. Garlic is relatively strong, so cut the pieces pretty small. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. Put the oil or butter in a pan that is more than big enough to hold the onion so you can stir the onion 
                    without pieces flying out of the pan. Turn the stove on and then to medium low. Put a piece of onion in the 
                    pan. When you hear the onion start to sizzle or change color, add the rest of the onion. Be aware that when 
                    you put water in hot oil it tends to spray up and that onions, like all vegetables, have a high water content. 
                    Turn the heat to low and cook for fifteen minutes, stirring frequently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    4. Add the salt and pepper. Add the cream cheese, if using. Stir.
                </p>

                <p>
                    5. Serve on crackers or toast, put on a salad, or add tomato for a simple tomato sauce.
                </p>

                    Congratulations! You cooked your first recipe. How did it go? What would you do next time?
                </p>

                <h6>Notes</h6>
                <p>Usually garlic is sold in heads of garlic. These have roots or a circle where roots came out of
                   and cloves, which are each wrapped in peel and about the size of the top of your finger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Variations: add chopped herbs such as basil, sage, or oregano after ten minutes of cooking.
                </p>
