            <p>
                Hi. Welcome. I am assuming you know nothing about cooking, so I'll try to start at the beginning. 
                If you think this isn't the right level for you, you can try one of the next three.
            </p>

            <p>
                So why cook? The first reason is probably to eat. If you can cook, food can be available 
                to you the way you like it, when you want it, more economically, and more healthfully than 
                otherwise. You might want to prove that you can, become more independent, celebrate holidays,
                or make food for someone else. Eventually, you may cook or bake to relax, to spend time with others,
                or to learn a new technique.

            </p>

            <p>
                While learning to cook, you will probably forget to put in leavening, and burn something. 
                In fact, you will probably do all of the above to many things, but over time (years)
                you will do so less frequently. It's going to be okay. You learn every time you make a 
                mistake. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Are you ready? Let's get started!
